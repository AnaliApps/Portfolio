# Portfolio

In this project I am implementing a fully functional portfolio site where a person can add projects into the site. The projects added will be saved locally using local storage. The site has a navigation section, home section, about section, portfolio section and contact section. Whenever any link in the navigation section is clicked it will display the appropriate section.
